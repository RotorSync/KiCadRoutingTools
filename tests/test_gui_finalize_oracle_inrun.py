"""#562 GUI parity: the plane finalize's ORACLE leg must run IN-RUN under
return_results, not be deferred to the applier.

WHY THIS IS A GATE. kicad-cli computes the exact fill, so the leg needs a
real file. The GUI has none mid-run, and the first implementation deferred:
it posted results_data['plane_finalize_oracle'] and swig_gui ran the oracle
AFTER applying the copper. That is not just a byte difference -- post-apply
is past the final reconciliation, so the oracle's unroutable links can no
longer feed custody and those nets never get the reconcile retry the CLI
gives them. batch_route(stage_board_fn=...) closes it: the caller hands back
a save of its LIVE board, the engine writes this run's pending copper onto
it (== the CLI's output_file at that point) and runs the oracle there.

Needs neither wx nor pcbnew: stage_board_fn only has to return a path to a
board file standing in for the live board, so a file copy is a faithful
stand-in for pcbnew.SaveBoard.
