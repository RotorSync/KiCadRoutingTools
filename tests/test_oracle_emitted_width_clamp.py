"""The oracle reconnect must not ship copper WIDER than it validated (#495/#496).

kicad_oracle's plane-link width upgrade runs a ladder (0.2/0.4/0.8) and gates
each rung on wide_route_clear. Two holes let an unvalidated width reach the
board:

  1. A DEGENERATE wide route (fewer than 2 points) has no same-layer legs, and
     wide_route_clear returns True vacuously for a leg-less route -- so the
     upgrade is accepted on an EMPTY check. The caller then re-routes with
     track_margin=0 (geometry sized for the nominal width) and that real path
     inherits the upgraded width.
  2. The same-net weld connectors (_extra_conn) are synthesized after the
     ladder and were never clearance-checked at all.

On rp2350_fpga_eensy this shipped 8 GND repair straps 0.026-0.361 mm inside
J1's 0.65 mm USB-C mounting hole, emitted at 0.8 mm against an obstacle map
stamped for the 0.0762 mm nominal width -- on a board the signal router had
left DRC-clean.

clamp_emitted_width re-checks the exact copper about to be written and steps
the width back down. It floors at the nominal width, so it can only decline an
UPGRADE -- never lose a link that would otherwise have shipped.
