"""Regression test for #493: routing geometry must not depend on the Python
version.

KiCad bundles its own interpreter (3.9 here) and the plugin runs inside it,
while the CLI tools run whatever `python3` is on PATH (3.14 here). So the SAME
board routed by the SAME code has to come out the same on both, or the GUI and
the CLI can never agree -- and neither can a corpus chain replayed on a machine
with a different python.

It did not. Python 3.12 changed the builtin `sum()` to use Neumaier compensated
summation:

    sum([0.65]*15)  ->  9.750000000000002   on 3.9   (naive accumulation)
                    ->  9.75                on 3.12+ (compensated)

`bga_fanout/grid.py` averaged clustered pad coordinates with
`sum(group)/len(group)`, so the BGA grid bounds came out 1-2 ULP apart
(min_x = 116.12500000000003 vs exactly 116.125). That is enough to flip a ball
sitting on an exact boundary tie from one escape direction to another, which
changed the channel and layer assignment and left eth_tap's U13 fanout with 109
tracks on one interpreter and 110 on the other -- and every later step of the
chain diverged from there.

`math.fsum` is exactly rounded and identical on every version, so cluster means
use it. This test pins the property two ways:

  1. the arithmetic itself (fsum stable where sum() is not), and
  2. the grid geometry a real in-repo BGA board produces, against values that
     are exact binary and therefore interpreter-independent by construction.

Uses only checked-in boards. Run under BOTH interpreters to compare:
