"""redo_stress_test --remap/--workdir must carry manifest SIDE-FILES.

seed_input_boards copies .kicad_pcb inputs into the replay dir, but a manifest
step can also take a plain file argument that lives in the original run dir and
is produced by no recorded command -- artix_devboard's
`--net-clearances net_clearances_1v8.json`. Replayed into a fresh dir that file
is absent, the step dies with FileNotFoundError, and the replay STILL exits
rc=0: the chain is silently truncated and the missing final board reads as a
routing failure.

Also pins the two things that make this safe to do by existence test:
  - numeric flag values (`--clearance 0.25`) and net names (`+3.3V`) must never
    be treated as files -- an extension-based test would match both;
  - values of OUTPUT flags must not be pre-seeded from a stale run dir.
