"""Placement legality geometry: board side, true board outline, courtyard rects.

The single home for the geometric predicates that decide whether a placement is
LEGAL, as opposed to merely cheap. Both placement engines consume it:

- ``placement/quench.py`` -- the perturbative nudge/rotate/swap optimizer
- ``placement/fanout_clearance.py`` -- the decoupling-cap repair pass

and so can a placement grader: `placement_overlap_area` (total courtyard overlap
area) and `placement_out_of_board` are the two legality metrics the placement
scorecard needs (#456, feeding #411/#110), computed by the same code the
optimizers gate on rather than by a second implementation that can disagree.

Two things here are easy to get wrong and are therefore centralized:

**Board side.** Parts on opposite sides of the board overlap in XY without
overlapping in copper -- a back-side decoupling cap legitimately sits under a
front-side BGA. A side-blind clearance check calls that a collision, and since
only CANDIDATE poses are validated (never the incumbent), every candidate near
such a part is rejected and the part freezes in place. But a THROUGH-HOLE part
does occupy both sides: its leads pass through the board. So a part occupies its
own side with its full courtyard, and the opposite side only with the bounding
box of its drilled pads (`sides_occupied` / `rect_on` / `pair_min_gap`).

**The board is not its bounding box.** `board_bounds` is an axis-aligned bbox
(kicad_parser), so an inset of it is blind to an L-shaped outline, a notch, or an
interior cutout -- a part gets nudged into the hole. `BoardOutlineGate` measures
against the real Edge.Cuts rings, with the three-level short-circuit that makes
it affordable: board-level opt-out when the outline IS its bbox, a cached
per-part reachable-disk prune, then the exact ring test.
