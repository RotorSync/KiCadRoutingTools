"""Generate an initial placement from a declared floorplan intent.

The placement stack refines; it deliberately does not place from scratch
UNAIDED (placement_state.py:13, docs/placement-optimization.md) -- handed a
pile of parts it has nothing to inherit constraints from. This module is the
aided path: the intent file IS the constraint carrier (zones, edge bands,
locks, decap rules), so a board whose repo declares one can get a legal,
deterministic, seeded starting placement instead of a refusal.

What each intent construct becomes, in placement order:

  1. ``edge_connectors``   the declared edge, overhang centered in the band,
                           distributed evenly along the edge. Placed WITHOUT
                           the legality gate: overhanging the outline is the
                           point, and candidate_valid would veto it.
  2. single-ref zones      the zone center -- the "few hundred microns around
                           the spec coordinate" pattern for spec-pinned parts.
  3. multi-ref zones       members packed radially from the zone center,
                           highest pin count first, constrained to the zone
                           rect plus its declared tolerance.
  4. everything else       nearest legal pose to the centroid of its already-
                           placed partners (fanout-capped, so GND does not
                           drag everything to the board middle) -- which is
                           also what lands a decap next to its IC.

Rotations: the input rotation is tried IN FULL first and kept when it fits;
a part with no contained legal pose at it falls back to its 90-degree
lattice, and the note names the change. The intent schema cannot express a
rotation, so a part whose rotation is a DECISION (pin order, the U3 rot-180
case) must be locked -- an unlocked load-bearing rotation was never
protected from the quench either. Explore rotations deliberately with
place_portfolio's `poses` strategy.

Determinism: the only randomness is ``random.Random(f"{seed}")`` -- it breaks
ties in the packing order and jitters non-spec targets, so different seeds
give genuinely different (still legal) seeds while the same seed reproduces
byte for byte. Everything else iterates sorted (#457).

    returns True.

    `exclude` carries the not-yet-placed refs: the pile they still form at
    their meaningless input coordinates must not veto real poses.

    candidate_valid alone is not the right gate here: for a part whose
    INCUMBENT pose is off the board (a generator's default position can be),
    its #456 branch accepts poses that move strictly TOWARD the board while
    still outside it -- measured: a free LDO seeded 2.7mm outside the
    outline, "placed", unseated 0. Placement from scratch has no incumbent
    worth improving on, so full containment is demanded explicitly; the only
    deliberate off-board poses are the edge connectors, which stage 1 places
    without this helper.

    The part's CURRENT rotation is tried in full first, then the rest of its
    90-degree lattice: an unplaced pile's rotation is a generator default,
    not a decision, and a large part can have NO contained legal pose at it
    while fitting fine turned 90 (measured: the same LDO, 0 poses at rot 0
    against 3 at rot 90 on a packed 51x21 board). A part whose rotation IS a
    decision must be locked -- an unlocked "load-bearing rotation" was never
    protected from the quench either (the U3 lesson). The caller can see a
    fallback fired by comparing the part's rot before and after.

    Returns the courtyard clearance the pose was found at, or None. The full
    clearance is demanded first; when the whole board offers nothing, the
    search reruns at half, then at a 0.02mm floor -- dense boards carry
    sub-clearance courtyard pairs BY DESIGN (the reference hand seed for the
    51x21 board places its LDO 0.04mm from a locked decap; a 0.05 floor
    still refused that board), and refusing to seed what a human
    deliberately packs would fail real boards. Courtyards carry their own
    margin, so a small courtyard-to-courtyard gap is not a copper hazard. A
    relaxed placement is a NOTE for the caller, never silent."""
