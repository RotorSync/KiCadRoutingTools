    coordinates. On a staggered multi-row package (AQFN and friends) the two
    offset rows project onto each axis at HALF the real pad spacing, so the
    reported pitch is half the truth and every downstream budget is computed
    against it. osprey_kb's Nordic_AQFN-73 reports `pitch 0.25` while 70 of its
    78 pads have a 0.5mm nearest neighbour; the escape budget then evaluates to
    `via <= -0.20mm` -- impossible for any via -- and the run spends 2967s
    dropping balls and retrying under-pad before finishing. qfn_fanout does the
    same chip in 2.4s with `--escape-method underpad --allow-via-in-pad`.
